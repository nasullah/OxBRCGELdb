        Welcome to the <a href="http://oxford-translational-molecular-diagnostics.org.uk/">Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre</a>  (OMDC) NGS LIMS. This system is a simple Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) designed specifically to support the workflow of sample management and preparation for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS).  It provides basic facilities for recording how samples were acquired, stored and processed together with details of any sequencing experiment performed on them.
    </p>

    <p>
        The system was originally commissioned to support the Genomics England (GeL) pilot study in which paired samples from cancer patients were obtained and processed to compare the sequencing of fresh frozen and formalin fixed but will continue to be developed and refined to be an easy-to-use system capable of supporting the kinds of throughput required for a regional cancer/rare disease genomics laboratory utilising NGS for the majority of its throughput.
    </p>

    <p>
        The system was designed by the staff of the <a href="http://oxford-translational-molecular-diagnostics.org.uk/">Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre</a> (OMDC) and the <a href="http://www.ouh.nhs.uk/services/referrals/genetics/genetics-laboratories/default.aspx">Oxford Genetics Laboratories </a> together with staff from the <a href="http://orb.ndcls.ox.ac.uk">Oxford Radcliffe Biobank </a> and pathologists and research nurses responsible for collecting and managing tissue in the <a href="http://www.ouh.nhs.uk/default.aspx">Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust</a>. Development was supported by the <a href="http://oxfordbrc.nihr.ac.uk">Oxford Biomedical Research Centre</a> and the Wellcome Trust/DoH HICF project <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/funding/Innovations/funded-projects/health-innovation-challenge-fund/index.htm">‘Translation of whole genome sequencing into clinical practice’</a>.  Additional consultancy was provided by <a href="http://www.genomicsengland.co.uk">Genomics England</a> and the <a href="http://www.modmedmicro.ac.uk">Modernising Molecular Microbiology project</a>.
